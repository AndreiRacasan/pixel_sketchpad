# Pixel Sketchpad

A simple toy project inspired by <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project" target="_blank">Odin's Etch-a-Sketch</a> challenge â€” a fun introduction to using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and reinforce the HTML and CSS skills learnt in the previous lessons. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed <a href="https://andreiracasan.github.io/pixel_sketchpad/" target="_blank">here</a>.
